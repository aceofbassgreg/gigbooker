How do obscure bands find obscure venues? They know someone who knows someone, and they waste a lot of time tracking these leads down. Meanwhile, small venues look for reliable bands who actually show up and at least resemble responsible human beings.

Gigbooker is a social networking app meant to help venues and bands find each other and write reviews based on reliability, among other things. It's currently in its infant stages but I look forward to building it out over the coming weeks!
